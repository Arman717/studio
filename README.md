# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

The AI features now use [CS-Flow](https://github.com/Arman717/cs-flow) for
defect detection. The wrapper scripts in `src/python` expect a Python
environment with the CS-Flow dependencies installed.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.
